## CFS LAB xCommunity Community: An elite center for Red Teams and Pentesters

We decided to deploy a server with a dedicated DISCORD membership. Join the exclusive community where Red Teams representatives share tools to circumvent the protection. The subscription opens up a whole arsenal of opportunities to bypass AV, EDR, XDR and other barriers, from file encryption to reliable C2 platforms.

### What is included in the subscription :

CFS - KILL AV/EDR Cryptor is our proprietary tool for obfuscation and encryption of payloads and your Malware. Bypasses the best antiviruses (Kaspersky, Defender, CrowdStrike), EDR (SentinelOne, Carbon Black, e.t.c.) and XDR. Supports polymorphic generation, debugging protection, and memory analysis. Full integration with Cobalt Strike, Nighthawk and other applications.

C2 and RAT Tools:  Full versions of Cobalt Strike, Nighthawk, Brute Ratel C4 (BRc4) and similar ‚Äîstealth C2, EDR/AV evasion, post-exploitation and durability. Ready-made profiles for Mimikatz, BOF, and custom payloads.

Resources for circumvention: obfuscation methods, manipulation of executable files (Mangle, RedGuard), bypassing the memory scanner. SourcePoint (CS) and AzureC2Relay manuals.

Certificates and signatures: Instructions for obtaining EV code signing certificates ‚Äî legally and anonymously ‚Äî for signing malware without checkboxes.

Red Team Ops: Attack schemes, advertising usage modules (BloodHound, Hashcat), network intelligence (Nmap). Training courses on malware development, BOF, cloud threat prevention, and other materials.

xCommunity: chat with red team experts, joint simulations, tool updates. Unlimited ‚Äî created for real pentests.
